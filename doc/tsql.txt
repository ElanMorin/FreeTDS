NAME
  tsql - utility to test FreeTDS connections and queries
SYNOPSIS
  tsql 	{-S servername [-I inside] | -H hostname -p port} 
 	-U username [-P password]

DESCRIPTION

	tsql is a diagnostic tool provided as part of FreeTDS. 
	It uses the TDS protocol directly to
	connect to Sybase or Microsoft SQL Servers, 
	and allows the user to issue queries that test the 
	capabilities of FreeTDS. 

	tsql is *not* a replacement for a complete isql, such as sqsh (www.sqsh.org). 
	It is designed to rely on the lowest level FreeTDS library, tdslib, as a way to
	isolate potential bugs in the protocol implementation. 

	tsql can be run in two ways, one which uses the freetds.conf and one
	which connects directly using the server's hostname and port. 

	When -S is used, FreeTDS uses the freetds.conf (or equivalent) and environment 
	variables in the normal way to determine the server's ip address and port. You can 
	use -I to specify a filename, overriding FreeTDS's configuration file search algorithm. 

	The -H and -p parameters are provided especially for troubleshooting new
	configurations (or servers). Use of these parameters causes FreeTDS to ignore
	any freetds.conf and environment variables. 


OPTIONS

	-S servername  the Database Server to which to connect.

	-I inside  a freetds.conf or interfaces file describing servername

	-H hostname  the DNS hostname of the server

	-p port  the port at which SQL Server is listening

	-U username  database login name.

	-P password  database password.


NOTES

	If you can connect with "tsql -S servername", your basic FreeTDS installation is working. 

	If you have suggestions for ways to make tsql more useful as a diagnostic tool,
	please recommend them to the FreeTDS mailing list for consideration.
