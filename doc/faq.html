<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p><font size="-1">
The <a href="http://www.freetds.org/userguide/">FreeTDS User
Guide</a>, included in each release, is the appropriate place for new
users to start.  
</p>
<p>

This list of frequently asked questions and answers about
FreeTDS is updated between releases to cover problems
since the last release, and to answer perennial questions (there are some).  
</p>
<p>You may find mention of a "Release 0.61".  There is none such (yet); that number refers to the current development version.  The last release of FreeTDS is version 0.60.1.

<h2>General Questions</h2>

<a name="What is FreeTDS"></a>
<h3> What is FreeTDS?</h3>

<p>FreeTDS is a free re-implementation of the TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol
that is used by Sybase and Microsoft for their database products. It currently
implements TDS 4.2, 5.0, 7.0 and 8.0, and can communicate with
any Sybase product as well as Microsoft SQL Server.</p>

<p>FreeTDS comes with a low level library (the TDS layer) along with a
number of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The current APIs are DB-Lib,
CT-Lib, and ODBC.</p>

<p>A JDBC driver has also been contributed under a BSDish license and is
available from the download page. It does not require the FreeTDS C
libraries.</p>


<a name="Where_do_I_get_FreeTDS"></a>
<h3>Where do I get FreeTDS?</h3>

<p>You can get the latest FreeTDS from Metalab or its mirrors. See 
"Quick Links" on the <a href="http://www.freetds.org/">FreeTDS</a> home page.  You may also 
use CVS (on sourceforge.net); see the User Guide for details.  </p>

<p>If your firewall prevents FTP access, you can download the JDBC 
<a href="http://www.rksystems.com/freetds_jdbc.jar">jar file</a> via http.  </p>

<p>Your favorite operating system may have a package of some kind
available.  You might want to check there.  Occasionally someone
contributes a package here, which we keep around.  Post a message to
the list if you're looking for one and don't find one in the usual
places. </p>

<a name="Does FreeTDS support MSSQL"></a>
<h3>Does FreeTDS support MSSQL?</h3>

<p>Yes, as long as you configure the libraries with the 4.2, 7.0 or 8.0 protocol
version. See the <a href="http://www.freetds.org/userguide/">User Guide</a> for details. </p>


<a name="Is there any documentation for the TDS protocol"></a>
<h3>Is there any documentation on the TDS protocol?</h3>

<p>Yes, there is some <a href="http://www.freetds.org/tds.html">preliminary documentation</a> available.</p>

<p>Sybase has also made the TDS 5.0 protocol documentation available
for free (price) download, however the license is too restrictive to be
used by developers of this project and the core developers have decided
to not obtain the documentation until all license issues are resolved.</p>


<a name="Is there other documentation I should know about"></a>
<h3>Is there other documentation I should know about?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>FreeTDS Users Guide, on <a

<a name="How can I get help"></a>
<h3>How can I get help (or support)?</h3>

<p>After reading this FAQ and the User Guide, you might want to look at the mailing list
<a href="http://franklin.oit.unc.edu/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?visit=freetds">archives</a>.  If you don't see
your question answered there (or, if you'd just like to learn more about what's going on with FreeTDS),
please subscribe to the 
<a href="http://www.freetds.org/contact.html">mailing list</a>.  Questions new and old are cheerfully
answered there.  Traffic is not high, normally around 10 messages a day.
</p>
<p><i>Netiquette note</i>:  It's considered poor form to mail "help me" questions directly to the
developers of <i>any</i> free software project, this one included.  Please direct your question to the
list, where someone with the available time and expertise can help you.</p>

<a name="Why LGPL license instead of license foo"></a>
<h3>Why LGPL license instead of license foo?</h3>

<p>
LGPL was chosen because if you want a commercial client, you can buy them
from Sybase, Microsoft or others. I do believe BSDish licenses are better
in some cases, but not for something like this.</p>

<p>You also have the following options you can add to the configure
statement:</p>
<dl><!-- second level list of terms -->
	<dt><tt>--with-tdsver=VERSION</tt></dt>
	<dd>specify the fallback TDS version

</dl> <!-- end nested dictionary list -->

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b> You must either build with TDS version 4.2 to access Microsoft SQL
Server or Sybase prior to 10.0 or change these values to 4.2 at runtime! TDS 7.0 may also be used to talk to Microsoft
SQL Server 7 and above.</p>

<a name="SYBASE"></a>
<h3>What is this <code>SYBASE</code> environment variable?</h3>

<p>
Many programs look for the <var>SYBASE</var> environment variable in order to
find the library's home. You will want to set this to the main FreeTDS
directory.  For example, if <code>FreeTDS</code> is installed in
<tt>/usr/local/freetds</tt> (meaning the libraries were installed in <tt>/usr/local/freetds/lib</tt>), then your <var>SYBASE</var> variable would be set to
<tt>/usr/local/freetds</tt>.</p>

<a name="other_environment_variables"></a>
<h3>What other environment variables are there?</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<var>TDSVER</var> will override the default TDS version, possible values are 4.2, 5.0,
7.0 and 8.0</li>

<li>
<var>TDSDUMP</var> will specify a location for a log file for debugging. Beware that
your database login passwords may be listed in this file.</li>

<li>
<var>TDSPORT</var> will override the default port for the server. Defaults are 1433
for TDS 4.2/7.0 and 4000 for TDS 5.0</li>
</ul>

<a name="RPM"></a>
<h3>How do I install the RPM?</h3>

<p>
<tt>rpm -ivh freetds-0.52-1.i386.rpm</tt> (as root) will install the
libraries.</p>
<p>
<tt>rpm -ivh freetds-devel-0.52-1.i386.rpm</tt> (as root) will install the
headers and other stuff needed to build other stuff.</p>

<p>One small PHP hint, mailed to the FAQ master in May 2001: </p>
	
<p>
In the mailing list archives I noticed a few people discussing a problem I
just had.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
An attempt to make a connection to a MS SQL server from PHP would fail,
leaving
a message in the Apache error log:
</p>
<pre>
        "connect: Network is unreachable
         DB-Library: Login incorrect"
</pre>
<p>
The problem turned out to be a very simple one to fix.
In the php.ini file under the sybase section, there is a directive that sets
the path
to the sybase interfaces file  "sybase.interface_file = "</p>
<p>
After uncommenting this and setting it to a reasonable value (ie.
/usr/local/freetds/interfaces),
things started working.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="Which Perl library should I use"></a>
<h3>Which Perl library should I use?</h3>

<p>There are four options for using TDS and Perl to connect to a Sybase
or MSSQL database, DBD::Sybase, DBD::ODBC, DBD::FreeTDS, and Sybperl. 
</p>
<p>
From Mark Schaal:
<br>
<p>DBD::Sybase is the recommended option, and yes it does work with MSSQL.
You will need to install the perl DBI module and the FreeTDS package, particularly
the CTLib portion. Set your SYBASE environment variable to /usr/local/freetds
and install DBD::Sybase. Don't worry too much if some of the tests fail.
Do worry if the module doesn't compile. Make sure you have the most recent
version of FreeTDS installed. You can check the 
<a href="http://franklin.oit.unc.edu/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?visit=freetds">mailing list archives</a>
 or ask the mailing list for help.
</p>
<p>DBD::FreeTDS does not depend on the FreeTDS libraries. It is minimally
functional but it is considered alpha software and is not being actively
developed.
</p>
<p>From Michael Peppler (mpeppler@peppler.org):
<br>Sybperl is a thin wrapper around the Sybase C APIs. It's a lot more
mature than DBI/DBD::Sybase (I've been working on it for 9 years :-) and
it's maybe more natural to use for someone who already knows the Sybase
APIs (or MS's DBlibrary). It's a little more powerful/flexible than DBI,
though obviously less portable. It's still actively maintained and developed
(by yours truly)
</p>
<p>From Brian:<br>
DBD::ODBC is the newest option available.  Its primary advantage is not having to load another DBI driver if you already have DBI::ODBC load for other systems.  On the downside, it may be a little less robust than DBD::Sybase.
</p>

<a name="Are there any known issues"></a>
<h3>Are there any known issues?</h3>

<p>ODBC can be confusing to set up, but it works, subject to limitations in the implementation.  See the samples directory for example .ini files.  
</p>
<p>BCP of text and image types is currently broken for Microsoft servers. 
</p>
<p>BCP does not support TDS 4.2.  You must use a more modern protocol version.  
</p>
<p>FreeTDS 0.60 was released without properly upgrading the library version numbers.  This can cause your applications to be confused.  You can use ldd(1) to check what library they're linking to, and you can use 0.60.1 to correct the version number problem.  See <a href="ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/ALPHA/freetds/README ">README.0.60.1</a> for details.  
</p>
<p><code>src/dblib/unittests/t0022</code> fails for Microsoft servers.  <font size="-1"><em>16 October 2002</em></font>
</p>


<a name="thread_safe"></a>
<h3>Is FreeTDS thread safe?</h3>

<p>
TDS is designed to be thread safe in the following manner. Different threads
may all use separate connections without interfering with each other.
Threads may not share a DBPROCESS or CS_CONNECTION without controlling
access via a mutex however.</p>

<a name="class_library"></a>
<h3>Any plans to write a C++ class library directly over TDS?</h3>
<p>
I have a JDBC-like class library written over dblib. I may port that (probably
not soon).</p>
<p>Another option may be using libodbc++, but I have not tested this.</p>

<a name="Are there plans to implement the OpenServer protocol/library"></a>
<h3>Are there plans to implement the OpenServer protocol/library?</h3>

<p>Not at this point, there is still much work to do on the client protocol.
But, <tt>libtdssrv</tt> will do the trick for some applications.</p>

<a name="jdbc_test"></a>
<h3>How can test my FreeTDS JDBC Driver?</h3>
<p>
           <a href="mailto:Seth.Rajkumar@GNI.co.uk">Rajkumar Seth</a> offers the following:
<pre>
  static void ftdsjdbc () {
    try {
    	// use your hostname and port number here
      String url = "jdbc:freetds:sqlserver://nt1:1433/master"; 
      String login = "sa"; // use your login here
      String password = "secret"; // use your password here

      if (false) { //Sybase 
        url = "jdbc:freetds:sybase://unix1:4100/master";

      }

      Class.forName("com.internetcds.jdbc.tds.Driver"); 
      
      //open a connection to the database
      Connection connection 
      	  = DriverManager.getConnection(url, login, password);
      //to get the driver version
      DatabaseMetaData conMD = connection.getMetaData();
      System.out.println("Driver Name:\t" + conMD.getDriverName());
      System.out.println("Driver Version:\t" + conMD.getDriverVersion());
      //create a statement
      Statement st = connection.createStatement();
      
      //execute a query
      ResultSet rs 
      	  = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM master.dbo.sysprocesses");

      // read the data and put it to the console
      while (rs.next()) {
        for (int j = 1; j &lt;= rs.getMetaData().getColumnCount(); j++) {
          System.out.print(rs.getObject(j) + "\t");
        }

        System.out.println();
      }

      //close the objects
      st.close();
      connection.close();
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }

<h3>Apache/PHP core dumps on start up</h3>

<p>
You'll probably need to compile FreeTDS with "--enable-dbmfix", then edit
PHP's "functions/sybase.c" file, and find any references to "dbopen" and
replace with "tdsdbopen", then compile and run etc...
</p>

<p>The reason for this is that Apache is linked against DBM which includes
a function named dbopen() too.</p>
<p>
Update: fixed in 0.53pre2, dbopen is now always a define to tdsdbopen

<h3>I get a message like "<tt>undefined symbol g_tds_err_handler</tt>" on Solaris.</h3>

<p>
There is a bug in the FreeTDS <tt>autoconf</tt> scripts on both Sparc and x86 platforms when linking to <tt>PHP</tt> and <tt>DBD::Sybase</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The workaround is to add "<font size="+1"><tt>-ltds</tt></font>" to the link command. 
</p>
<p>
For <tt>PHP</tt>, edit the <tt>EXTRA_LIBS</tt> line in <tt>config_vars.mk</tt>

<p>
For <tt>DBD::Sybase</tt> edit the Makefile after running <b><kbd>perl Makefile.PL</kbd></b>.  (Please send mail to the list if this doesn't help.)  
</p>
<p>
If you have a Solaris machine and the requisite <tt>autoconf</tt> skills to fix this, a patch would be appreciated.

<p>Mark J. Lilback rolled up his sleeves and solved this.  But, it's not baby simple, because you have to use bleeding edge tools.  The latest stable release of libtool, which FreeTDS uses to generate its configure script, doesn't do what you need.  But, as a dynalib builder, you're used to that, eh?   
</p>
<p>To get started, first, obtain a current CVS version.  Then follow Mark's instructions:
</p>

Here's the final process that allows compiling out of cvs. I've 
tested it on a clean install (after mucking around with many 
solutions on my system) and it should work for anyone on 10.2.
</p>
<p>

The steps seem kinda stupid in some places, but that's because most 
users don't have a /usr/local/bin and it isn't in the path by 
default. I also avoided giving shell commands because the default 
shell is tcsh and I refuse to deal with anything other than bash.
</p>

<ol>
<li>If you don't have /usr/local/bin, create it.</li>

<li>Run the command "ln -s /usr/bin/glibtoolize /usr/local/bin/libtoolize"</li>

<li>Add /usr/local/bin to your path if not there.</li>

<li>Download and install autoconf-2.54, making sure it is in your 
path. I installed it in /usr/local/autoconf-2.54 and added 
/usr/local/autoconf-2.54/bin to my path just for getting freetds to 
work, but I'm paranoid about updating Apple-supplied software.</li>

<li>Apply the patch <http://www.lilback.com/misc/ltmain.diff> to 
/usr/share/libtool/ltmain.sh. This modifies the installed libtool 
with a libtool patch that is in CVS but has not made it into a public 
release.</li>

<li>Follow the normal instructions for compiling freetds from cvs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
After this, they compile and the unit tests work up to dblib0013, 
which hung for 10 minutes or so until I canceled it.

</p>
<p>
There were a couple of other issues I want to clean up at some point 
(like the fact that iODBC is installed on the system by default, so 
there is no need to specify a directory), but it works with the above 
steps.

<h2>Problems Running</h2>

<a name="Why is my TDS protocol wrong"></a>
<h3>Why is my TDS protocol wrong since upgrading to 0.53?</h3>

<p>You upgraded your FreeTDS library and now seem to be 
connecting at a different protocol version, but your interfaces file hasn't changed.  What gives?
</p>

<p>Between the 0.51 and 0.53 releases a lot of changes went into the 
configuration options.  Formerly, at least three different schemes existed
for specifying the protocol version: </p>

<table border=1>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Location</b></td>
		<td><b>Example format</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>build-time (<tt>./configure</tt>)</td>
		<td>4.2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>interfaces file</td>
		<td>tds4.2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>TDSVER environment variable</td>
		<td>42</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The preferred form is now 4.2 and 
the others are deprecated and have been or will be removed in subsequent 
releases.</p>

<a name="unknownmarker"></a>
<h3>What does this <tt>unknown marker</tt> message mean?</h3>

<p>Most of the time, it means you're not using the right protocol version.  That <i>can</i> happen even if your <tt>./configure</tt> was done correctly.  Try setting the <tt>TDSVER</tt> to 70.  If that works, double check your work.  If your interfaces file and ./configure were right, but you needed the environment variable anyway, please post a message to the list and help us track it down.  </p>

<a name="connectionrefused"></a>
<h3>What if I get a <tt><font size="+1">connection refused</font></tt>
message?</h3>

<p>You want to make sure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>your server is running,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>you can connect to it,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>your account has permissions in the database to execute your query.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Try <tt>telnet &lt;hostmachine&gt; &lt;port&gt;</tt> and see if it's listening.
You should get some form of response from the server (actual text varies
by vendor &amp; version).<br>&nbsp;</li>

	<li><p>Try <kbd>tsql -U &lt;hostmachine&gt; -p &lt;port&gt; -U &lt;username&gt; -P &lt;password&gt; </kbd></p>
	<p>That will connect to the server, bypassing the freetds.conf file.  If it doesn't work, the problem lies upstream.  </p> </li>
	
	<li><p>Try <kbd>tsql -S &lt;servername&gt; -p &lt;port&gt; -U &lt;username&gt; -P &lt;password&gt; </kbd></p>
	<p>That will connect to the server using freetds.conf.  This allows you to isolate freetds.conf mistakes.  <kbd>man tsql</kbd> for more.  </p> </li>

	<li>Check your ./configure and environment variables. The <tt>--with-tdsver</tt> determines what flavor of the TDS protocol your runs by default; the $TDSVER variable overrides that default.  The following combinations are reasonable:</li>


<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Vendor</b></td>

<td><b>Version</b></td>

<td><b>TDS Version</b></td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>Sybase</td>

<td>4.92+&nbsp;</td>

<td>5.0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Microsoft</td>

<td>6.0, 6.5</td>

<td>4.2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Microsoft</td>

<td>7.0/2000</td>

<td>7.0</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

	<li><p>Edit the <b><tt>PWD</tt></b> file and try <tt>make check</tt>.  It will call unittests for libtds, ctlib, dblib and odbc in that order</p></li>

	<li><p>Compile <font size="+1"><tt><a href="http://www.sqsh.org">sqsh</a></tt></font>
and try that before the more complicated stuff (PHP/Perl). If you can connect
with <tt>sqsh</tt>, you don't have a FreeTDS problem.</p></li>

</ol>

<a name="integratedsecurity"></a>
<h3>The Microsoft SQL Server is listening, my configuration and environment
are set up per question 6.1, but logins still fail.</h3>

<p>Yeah, make sure you're not relying on integrated security.  Microsoft
supports two security models in three permutations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Windows NT Authentication Mode (Windows NT Authentication)</li>

<li>
Standard Mode (SQL Server Authentication)</li>

<li>
Mixed Mode (Windows NT Authentication and SQL Server Authentication)</li>
</ol>
<p>You need either Standard or Mixed mode. </p>
<p>"Windows NT Authentication", often called "integrated security", relies
on Microsoft's trusted connections and is not supported by FreeTDS. In
it, user's network security attributes are established at network login
time. When connecting to the database server, SQL Server uses Windows NT
facilities to determine the validated network username. SQL Server then
permits or denies login access based on that network username alone, without
requiring a separate login name and password.
</p>
<p>FreeTDS supports the traditional database security model, which Microsoft
terms "SQL Server Authentication" but is frequently known as "standard
security". Username+Password pairs have to be passed to the server explicitly.
</p>
<p>Mixed Mode allows users to connect using either authentication method.
Users who connect through a Windows NT account can make use of trusted
connections in either Windows NT Authentication Mode or Mixed Mode. After
successful connection to SQL Server, the security mechanism is the same
for both modes.
</p>
<p>Update: support for "Windows NT Authentication" has been added in 0.60. This code is quite new, hasn't seen much use and might work.  ;)
</p>

<A name=textdata></a>
<h3>My <tt>text</tt> data are being truncated or are causing my client to 
break.</h3>
<p>The <tt>text</tt> data type is different from <tt>char</tt> and 
<tt>varchar</tt> types. The maximum data length of a <tt>text</tt> column is 
governed by the <tt>textsize</tt> variable on the server. Microsoft 
<I>claims</I> in their documentation to use a default <tt>textsize</tt> of 4000 
characters, but in fact their implementation is inconsistent. Sometimes 
<tt>text</tt> columns are returned with a size of 4 GB! </p>
<p>The best solution is to make sure you set <tt>textsize</tt> to a reasonable 
value when establishing a connection.  For example: </p>

<!-- example set textsize 1000 (see UG) -->
<pre class="screen">
<tt class="userinput">
<b>set <tt class="envar">textsize</tt> = 10000</b></tt>
</pre>

<A name=dateformat></a>
<h3>My dates aren't formatted right!</h3>
<p>Some dates turn out better than others. </p>
<p>If you think your dates should look like <em>2001-12-13 17:58:55.000</em>, 
but you're seeing something like <em>Dec 13 2001 05:58PM</em> instead (or vice 
versa), you've bumped into driver behavior. There's no standard governing the 
default character string representation of a <code>datetime</code> datatype. Different drivers 
make different choices, and your driver has chosen a representation for you. 
</p>Microsoft's ODBC driver (which is used by among other things the Query 
Analyzer tool) converts <tt>datetime</tt> to an ISO format. That format has the 
advantages of being all numeric: sortable, unambiguous, and 
locale-independent. <code>db-lib</code> and <code>ct-lib</code>, in contrast, 
as well as the FreeTDS <code>ODBC</code> 
driver, use the <code>MMM DD YYYY hh:mm</code> format (fixed in CVS, October 2002). 
<p>If you want to be sure your queries always return dates in a particular 
format, don't leave the formatting up to the driver! Use the <code>Convert</code> 
function. For example:  </p>

<!-- example convert  -->
<pre class="screen"><tt class="userinput">

1&gt; select convert( varchar(30), getdate(), 120 ) as Now
2&gt; go
 Now
 ------------------------------
 2002-07-02 12:36:31
</tt></pre>

<p>As of version 0.60, the default datetime-&gt;string conversion is controlled by the <code>locale.conf</code> file.  See the User Guide for details.  

<p>There are two other date issues.  
<ol>
	<li>FreeTDS dates are restricted to the range supported by the standard C library, approximately from 1970 to 2038.  This restriction was lifted with version 0.60.</li>
	<li>Big endian clients experience difficulty with Microsoft servers.  See <em>Known Issues</em> in the <a href="http://www.freetds.org/userguide/">User Guide</a>.  </li>
</ol>
