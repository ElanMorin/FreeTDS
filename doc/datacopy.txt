NAME
  datacopy - move table data between two servers
SYNOPSIS
  datacopy [-t | -a | -c owner] [-b batchsize] [-p packetsize] [-v] [-d]
           [-S server/username/password/database/table|view]
           [-D server/username/password/database/table]

DESCRIPTION
  datacopy is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS. 
  datacopy will move table data from one server to another, without
  the need for intermediate files. Using datacopy will be much faster
  and more efficient than using freebcp out/in.

  datacopy makes use of the dblib bcp api built into FreeTDS. This 
  api is also available to application developers.

  datacopy can be used to migrate data between Sybase ASE and SQL Server
  or vice versa.

OPTIONS
  -t            truncate target table before loading data

  -a            append data to target table
  
  -c owner      create the target table with the same schema as the source
                table. datacopy will submit a 'create table' command on 
                the target server/database using the specified owner in 
                the command, e.g. create table owner.table (...

  -b batchsize  is the number of rows per batch of data copied. 
                Each batch of data is effectively 'committed'
                into the database. the default value for batchsize is 1000. 

  -p packetsize Specifies the number of bytes, per network packet, sent to 
                and from the server(s). Increased packet size can enhance 
                performance.

  -v            produce verbose output, including diagnostic timings.

  -d            produce freetds TDSDUMP output (serious debug only!)

  -S ...        specifies the connection information for the source server
                and the location/name of the table (or view) to be copied.
                The argument to the -S option is in the format:

                server/username/password/database/table|view

                If the -S option is not specified, datacopy will prompt the 
                user to enter this data.

  -D ...        specifies the connection information for the destination server
                and the location/name of the target table.
                The argument to the -D option is in the format:

                server/username/password/database/table

                If the -D option is not specified, datacopy will prompt the 
                user to enter this data.
