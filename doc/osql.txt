NAME
  osql - utility to test FreeTDS connections and queries

SYNOPSIS
  osql 	-S datasource_name -U username -P password
	
DESCRIPTION

osql is a diagnostic tool provided as part of FreeTDS. It is a 
Bourne shell script that checks and reports on your configuration
files.  If everything checks out OK, it invokes isql. 

osql works the isql that comes with unixODBC only.  

OPTIONS

	-S servername  the Database Server to which to connect, as known
	   to odbc.ini.  

	-U username  database login name.

	-P password  database password.

EXAMPLE

If you have an odbc.ini with a section like this:

	[myDSN]
		servername = myserver
		TDS_Version = 5.0
	
You would invoke osql as:

	osql -S myDSN

NOTES

If you can connect with "osql -S servername -U user -P passwd", your 
FreeTDS ODBC installation is working. 

If you have suggestions for ways to make osql more useful as a diagnostic tool,
please recommend them to the FreeTDS mailing list for consideration. 

HISTORY

osql first appeared in FreeTDS 0.65.
