NAME
  freebcp - bulk loading utility for Sybase and Microsoft databases
SYNOPSIS
  freebcp [database.[owner].]table_name {in | out} datafile 
    { -c | -n | -f formatfile }
    [-b batchsize] [-F firstrow] [-L lastrow] [-e errfile] 
    [-I interfaces_file] [-m maxerrors] [-t field_term] [-r row_term] 
    [-S servername] [-U username] [-P password]

DESCRIPTION
  freebcp is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS. 
  freebcp replicates (in part at least) the functionality
  of the "bcp" utility programs distributed by Sybase and Microsoft.

  freebcp makes use of the dblib bcp api built into FreeTDS. This 
  api is also available to application developers.

  The manual pages or online help for Sybase or SQL Server can be 
  referenced for more detailed information on "bcp" functionality.

TABLES AND FILES
  database      is optional if the table being copied is in your 
                default database or in master. Otherwise, you must
                specify a database name.

  owner         is optional if you or the database owner are the owner 
                of the table being copied.

  table_name    is the name of the database table you wish to access. 

  in | out      is the direction of the bulk copy operation. 
                'in' indicates that data is being copied from a host
                file into a database table, 'out' indicates that data
                is being copied from a database table to a host file.

  datafile      is the full path name of an operating system file.

OPTIONS
  -c            specifies that the host data file is in 'character' format. 
		Briefly, this means the following: 
                that all data in the file is (or will be written) in ASCII;
                that the \t (tab) is the default field terminator; 
                that \n (newline) is the default row terminator.

  -n            specifies that the host data file is in 'native' format.
                This is a format that freebcp will be able to process,
                but is not portable or readable.

  -f formatfile  specifies that the format of the host data file is described 
                 by the specified formatfile. The format of formatfile
                 is identical to that understood by Sybase or MS bcp,
                 but is too complicated to describe here.

  -b batchsize  is the number of rows per batch of data copied. Batching 
                applies only when you are bulk copying into the
                database. each batch of data is effectively 'committed'
                into the database. the default value for batchsize is
                1000 .

  -F firstrow   is the number of the first row to copy from the input file or
                database table the default is the first row. 

  -L lastrow    is the number of the last row to copy from an input file  or
                database table the default is the last row. 

  -r row_term   specifies the row terminator. Default is newline ('\n') 

  -t field_term  specifies the field terminator. Default is tab ('\t')

  -S servername  specifies the name of the Database Server to which to connect. 

  -U username   specifies a database login name. 

  -P password   specifies a database password.


NOTES
  To date, freebcp has been tested against Sybase ASE 11, and SQL
  Server 2000. There are currently a number of restrictions on its use.

  When connecting to a Sybase database server, it is required that the
  TDS 5.0 protocol be used. When connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server
  2000 database server, the TDS 8\.0 protocol is required.

  Theoretically both Sybase and Microsoft support the TDS 4.2 protocol,
  but in reality they implement the bcp portion of TDS 4.2 differently.
  Freetds has no way of knowing which type of server it's connected to,
  hence TDS protocol 4.2 is not supported.

HISTORY
  freebcp first appeared in FreeTDS 0\.60

BUGS
  Currently, there is no support for text data types in freebcp, when
  SQL Server 2000 is the target database.

  The following parameters are accepted but unimplemented
	[-e errfile]              
	[-I interfaces_file]      
	[-m maxerrors]
