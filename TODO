This list is ordered top-to-bottom by priority.  
Things that are broken and need mending are at the top, 
followed by things that should work before the next release, 
followed by features that should be added/fixed/reworked.  

Everyone is encouraged to add to the list.  Developers can do it directly; 
anyone else can post a patch to Source Forge.  
In this way we can communicate with each
other about the project's priorities and needs.

------------
Broken:
For 0.61 version:
. thorough rototilling of the code for cleanliness, I would like it to 
  build with (at least) -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes -Werror
For future versions:
. test conversion from char. Does libraries append blank to reach column_size ?
  same problem for binary (padded with zeroes) ?
. numeric conversions.
. move error message macro/prototype to tds.h.in; use in dblib.c. 
. conversion from ucs2 to utf8, provide for 2+ bytes/character.
  (multibyte support)
. Remove old char(30) limitations to various sysnames e.g., tables, columns, 
  passwords.  
. Add bcp support to tds/dblib/ctlib. (started in dblib)
. Array binding for ctlib not working
. RPC stuff not implemented
. All manner of unimplemented functions
. ct_dynamic and friends needed for DBD::Sybase placeholder support (partly done)
. Server API needs more work, especially for TDS 5.0/7.0
. Add support for TDS 8.0 (login works)
. TDS 7 Unicode to native charset conversion using iconv (partly done)
. tdsping program for testing purposes
. autoconf the connection pooling stuff
. Make pool configuration a non-recompile process
. Add missing constants needed for python and verify working
. Add missing constants needed for Gnome-DB and verify working 
. Someone broke early binding in ODBC
. Autodetect TDS protocol when connecting (and cache somewhere?)

(f77) Those was collected from ML...
. ODBC: get a solid corpus of unittests for ODBC, and have it become a 
  top tier API.
. DBLIB: output params
. placeholder support for TDS 5.0.  This is partially done but crashes
. get connection pooling working with all protocol versions
. Finish off the TDS dissector for ethereal
. ODBC: dynamic query (need rewrite SQLPrepare and related)
. ODBC: improve, best error report (even multiple)
. ODBC: be able to ignore freetds.conf using SQLDriverConnect, more
  compatiblity with windows one (finish)
. dynamic query (even for mssql)
. cursor support
. more solid. handle out of memory conditions (started, we must test all 
  allocation and all function that return allocated data and be able to 
  rollback to a safe state)
. limit copy of data (now wire -> tds -> temp -> client)

Tests
- "if 0 = 1 select 1" should not fail
- test dynamic query
