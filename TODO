This list is ordered top-to-bottom by priority.  
Things that are broken and need mending are at the top, 
followed by things that should work before the next release, 
followed by features that should be added/fixed/reworked.  

Everyone is encouraged to add to the list.  Developers can do it directly; anyone
else can post a patch to Source Forge.  In this way we can communicate with each
other about the project's priorities and needs.
