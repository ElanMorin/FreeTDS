	* include/tds.h.in, src/tds/token.c (tds_process_col_name):
	optimisation to add the column name length in the tds_column_info
	structure so as to obviate the need for strlen calls higher up.
	Since the length value is already available, this costs nothing.
	Derived from a patch by Ruslan R. Laishev <laishev@mail.dls.net>

Wed Oct 31 12:21:57 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* src/ctlib/ct.c (ct_results): return CS_END_RESULTS instead of
	CS_SUCCEED on subsequent call after we had returned CS_SUCCEED.
	Related to special handling of queries with no result sets.  PHP
	was looping trying to flush the connection of result sets after
	the first one.
