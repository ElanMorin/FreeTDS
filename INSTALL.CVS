Building FreeTDS from CVS

1) satisfy build dependencies, ensure that the following packages are
   installed:

	automake	(GNU Automake, generates Makefile.in from Makefile.am)
	autoconf	(GNU Autoconf, generates configure from configure.in)
	libtool		(GNU Libtool, library creation support scripts)
	make		(GNU Make, appears on some systems as gmake)
	gcc		(GNU Compiler Collection, for C code compilation)
	
	Autotool versions that work:
	$ (autoconf --version; automake --version; libtool --version) |grep GNU
	autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.57
	automake (GNU automake) 1.7.3
	ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 1.4a (1.641.2.255 2001/05/22 10:39:30)
	
	The above are used to generate the distributions.  
	You may get away with older versions, as far back as 2.53 for autoconf.

2) execute autogen.sh to run automake, autoconf and configure,

	./autogen.sh

3) compile the source using make, (or gmake if your system's make is
   not GNU make),

	make

5) switch to a user that can write to the target installation
   directory, usually root,

	su root

4) install the package,

	make install
