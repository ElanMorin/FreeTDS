------------
Added test.sh to run all tests from 'make test', reduced the rows_to_add to 50
and relocated the user/password/server/database information to a common file to
be used for all CLIs.

-------------
The programs in this directory will test the dblib routines.  Tests
that dblib passes will print "dblib okay for t000X.c" as the last line
of output and exit with a status of 0.  If the test does not print
that message for the last line of output it means that dblib failed
that test.  

Some of the tests are designed to dump core if an error is detected.
This is to assist with post-mortem debugging of the dblib routines.


**** Notice **** 
As of January 20, 1999 t0003.c is broken.  The test
fails on Microsoft's DB Library.
