#
# This format of the interfaces file is this:
#
# The entry starts with the servername beginning in the first column (no 
# whitespace preceding it).  
# 
# Next comes the services lines. They must be preceded by some whitespace
# (preferably a tab). There are five fields in the services line.
#
# 1) The service.     Currently only "query" means anything "master" is present
#                     for historical reasons only.
# 2) The transport.   Currently ignored by FreeTDS, it should be "tcp".  When
#                     ipv6 support is added a second option of "tcp6" will 
#                     probably be available.
# 3) Physical layer.  Sybase uses this field for a description of the physical
#                     layer (usually "ether"), FreeTDS can also use it to 
#                     specify the version of the protocol to use when connecting
#                     to this server.
# 4) Hostname.        May be a hostname or IP address of the server machine.
# 5) Port.            The TCP port of the dataserver. MS SQL defaults to 1433
#
# So putting it all together, let's say you have an NT box running a SQL Server
# named "myserver" at ip address 10.0.2.1 and we are connecting using version
# 4.2 of the protocol, your interfaces entry would look 
# like this: (without the comments)
#
#myserver
#	query tcp 4.2 10.0.2.1 1433
#

JDBC
	query tcp 5.0 192.138.151.39 4444
	master tcp 5.0 192.138.151.39 4444

myserver
	query tcp ether 127.0.0.1 4000
	master tcp ether 127.0.0.1 4000

myserver2
	query tcp ether 127.0.0.1 4001
	master tcp ether 127.0.0.1 4001
